Roadmap references: `Ix.Ey` = Initiative/Epic from `tasks.md`.

- [ ] [I2.E2] Consume validated plan graphs and enforce schema-budget constraints during orchestration.
- [ ] [I3.E2] Query semantic memory (`memory.search`) pre-flight and blend results into planning prompts.
- [ ] [I3.E3] Detect frequented sub-graphs to propose procedural templates and parameterise them for reuse.
- [ ] [I6.E1] Preserve evidence links and source snippets throughout aggregation to satisfy explainability requirements.
- [ ] [I6.E2] Integrate bias/credibility scores when ranking results and expose adjustments for UI controls.
- [ ] [I6.E4] Emit planner decision traces and memory hits to support explainability UI endpoints.
