# Module Tasks â€” internal/agent/core

Roadmap references: `Ix.Ey` = Initiative/Epic from `tasks.md`.

- [x] [I2.E2] Ensure orchestrator consumes validated plan graphs, enforces dependency ordering, and respects budget constraints.
- [x] [I2.E2] Integrate planner JSON schema validation errors into orchestrator feedback for retries.
- [ ] [I3.E2] Blend semantic memory context (`memory.search`) into planning prompts and routing decisions.
- [ ] [I3.E3] Detect recurring task sub-graphs, materialise procedural templates, and coordinate approvals with memory.
- [ ] [I6.E1] Propagate evidence links (source IDs/snippets) through every agent stage to satisfy explainability requirements.
- [ ] [I6.E4] Emit planner decision traces and memory hit telemetry for the explainability UI and audit trail.
