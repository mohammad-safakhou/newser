üß≠ Final Initiatives & Epics (feasibility-checked)

Below is the final set (small refinements in bold). Each initiative lists dependencies and a crisp Definition of Done (DoD).

1) Core Platform & Safety Foundation

Why: everything depends on this.
‚Ä¢	Epics
1.	Service decomposition (API, Worker, Executor, Crawler, Memory) via Redis Streams (or NATS).
DoD: services run independently; queue durable; idempotency keys; checkpoints.
2.	Secrets & config hygiene (.env + Vault/SOPS), CI secret scanning.
DoD: no secrets in repo; failing CI on leak.
3.	Observability (OpenTelemetry + Prometheus/Grafana).
DoD: per-run trace (tokens, duration, cost); dashboards committed.
4.	Security & Policy Engine (new: make it explicit): sandbox profiles (NSJail/Docker), domain allowlists, time/memory caps, HTML sanitizers.
DoD: every tool execution goes through sandbox + policy; XSS tests green.
‚Ä¢	Depends on: none.

2) Dynamic Orchestration Engine

Why: LLM-planned graphs (bounded, validated).
‚Ä¢	Epics
1.	Capability Registry (ToolCards: name, version, I/O schema, limits, side-effects).
DoD: registry API + signed manifests; unknown tool ‚áí hard fail.
2.	Planner Model ‚Üí JSON plan graph (acyclic, schema-valid).
DoD: invalid plans rejected with reasons; budget pre-check.
3.	Graph Executor (checkpoints, retries, backpressure).
DoD: restart resumes mid-graph; exponential backoff; max concurrency.
4.	Budget Watchdog (explicit): time/token/$ guards; human gate for high-risk.
DoD: plans aborted on breach with clean state + report.
‚Ä¢	Depends on: Initiative 1.

3) Memory & Experience System

Why: reuse intelligence, cut cost/latency, improve over time.
‚Ä¢	Epics
1.	Episodic memory (store plan graph, prompts, tool calls, outputs, artifacts).
DoD: any run is replayable by ID.
2.	Semantic memory (embed intents/outcomes; pgvector).
DoD: memory.search returns similar runs/sub-plans with confidence.
3.	Procedural memory (save sub-graphs as parameterized templates).
DoD: planner proposes a prior sub-plan when similar.
4.	Memory tools (search, write, summarize) + Memory Manager (prune/TTL/cluster).
DoD: memory size bounded; nightly maintenance job; quality metrics logged.
‚Ä¢	Depends on: 1, 2.

4) Tool Execution Environment (code & terminal)

Why: let the agent ‚Äúdo work‚Äù like a human, safely.
‚Ä¢	Epics
1.	Code runners (Python, Node) with JSON I/O, time/mem caps, network off by default.
DoD: run snippet ‚Üí JSON out; artifacts captured; kill on limit.
2.	Terminal tools (whitelist: curl, jq, grep, headless browser wrapper).
DoD: all calls audited; non-whitelisted blocked.
3.	Black-box apps as tools (declared I/O; version pinned).
DoD: reproducible outputs by version.
4.	Result capture (stdout/stderr/artifacts) + attachment store (S3-compatible).
DoD: artifacts linked in run trace.
‚Ä¢	Depends on: 1 (sandbox/policy), 2 (registry/executor).

5) Web-Scale Crawling & Indexing

Why: global coverage; freshness.
‚Ä¢	Epics
1.	Distributed crawler (async workers; robots.txt; polite rate limits).
DoD: seed list + sitemap/RSS discovery; crawl queue with politeness.
2.	Dedup & canonicalization (SimHash/MinHash; URL normalize; UTM strip).
DoD: near-dup rate < threshold; canonical URL stored.
3.	Index & search API (Postgres + pgvector; hybrid lexical/semantic).
DoD: top-k retrieval latency SLO met; API used by planner.
4.	Ethical boundaries (paywall respect, attribution, cache TTL, opt-out).
DoD: policy config file; crawler refuses disallowed domains.
‚Ä¢	Depends on: 1 (observability/policy), 4 (optional headless fetch).

Feasibility note: ‚ÄúWeb-scale‚Äù is achieved by horizontal workers + incremental discovery (RSS/sitemaps/backfill search) + rate governance. You can start small (tens of thousands of pages/day) and scale by adding worker nodes; architecture supports it.

6) Trust, Auditability & Transparency

Why: credibility and debugging.
‚Ä¢	Epics
1.	Evidence linking (claim ‚Üî source IDs + offsets/snippets).
DoD: each output item lists sources; click-through to excerpt.
2.	Bias & credibility scores (domain trust map; user overrides).
DoD: ranking visibly affected by settings; logged in trace.
3.	Audit trail (model versions, costs, retrievals; signed run manifest).
DoD: exportable run JSON for compliance/debug.
4.	Explainability UI (‚ÄúWhy included?‚Äù, planner/Memory decisions).
DoD: side panel shows plan nodes and memory hits.
‚Ä¢	Depends on: 2, 3, 5.

7) User Experience & Builder Interface

Why: make all power accessible.
‚Ä¢	Epics
1.	Conversational builder (edits Topic/Blueprint/View/Route schemas).
DoD: NL ‚Üí valid config; diff preview before save.
2.	Layout studio (timeline/cards/table/badges; live MJML preview).
DoD: web/email share the same View schema; email ‚â§ 102KB clip.
3.	Dashboard (topics, last runs, costs, health).
DoD: red/amber/green per topic with drill-down.
4.	Accessibility & i18n (WCAG 2.2; i18next; PWA).
DoD: automated a11y tests pass; RTL supported.
‚Ä¢	Depends on: 2, 6.

8) Community, Evaluation & Governance

Why: keep quality high and OSS healthy.
‚Ä¢	Epics
1.	Docs & API site (Quickstart, Architecture, Tool Registry, API explorer).
DoD: docs.newser.* live; versioned; examples runnable.
2.	Plugin registry (discovery + install/import; signed manifests).
DoD: at least 5 example connectors/templates.
3.	Evaluation harness (retrieval precision/factuality; CI gates).
DoD: PRs fail on quality regression beyond thresholds.
4.	Governance & releases (LICENSE, CoC, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, CHANGELOG).
DoD: monthly minor releases; security disclosure process documented.
‚Ä¢	Depends on: 1‚Äì7 (to document and test).

üß™ Feasibility gates (start checklist)

You‚Äôre ready to implement if you can check these:
‚Ä¢	Containerized sandbox ready (NSJail/Docker) with CPU/mem/time/network limits.
‚Ä¢	Redis Streams (or NATS) available; Postgres with pgvector extension.
‚Ä¢	Object storage (S3-compatible) configured for artifacts.
‚Ä¢	Domain allowlist and robots policy defined.
‚Ä¢	CI in place (lint, tests, secret scan, basic e2e).
‚Ä¢	Team comfortable with OpenTelemetry basics.

If any are missing, bootstrap them in Initiative 1‚Äîthey‚Äôre quick wins and unblock everything else.

üó∫Ô∏è Build order (thin vertical slices)
1.	I1 Core ‚Üí queue, sandbox, OTel.
2.	I2 Orchestration ‚Üí registry + planner + executor + budget watchdog.
3.	I3 Memory ‚Üí episodic/semantic + memory.search in planning path.
4.	I4 Tools ‚Üí code runner + terminal adapters (JSON I/O).
5.	I5 Crawl/Index ‚Üí RSS/sitemap first, then expand; dedup; search API.
6.	I6 Trust ‚Üí evidence + audit; ‚ÄúWhy included?‚Äù panel.
7.	I7 UX ‚Üí conversational builder + layout studio (MJML/web).
8.	I8 Community/Eval ‚Üí docs, plugin gallery, CI quality gates.

Each step yields a usable product; no big-bang required.

üß® Risks & mitigations (final)
‚Ä¢	Cost/latency blow-ups ‚Üí budget watchdog; memory reuse; caching retrievals.
‚Ä¢	Prompt injection / XSS ‚Üí policy engine + sanitizer + provenance tags; headless fetcher never pipes raw HTML to prompts.
‚Ä¢	Crawler legal/ethics ‚Üí robots/paywall respect, attribution, TTLs, per-domain rate limits.
‚Ä¢	Plan chaos ‚Üí acyclic validator; tool schemas; human gate on risky ops.
‚Ä¢	Memory bloat/stale ‚Üí TTL + clustering + success-weighted retention.
‚Ä¢	Email/Slack limits ‚Üí layout budgeter; MJML compile checks; Block Kit validators.
